    <section id="about">
        <h2> About Us</h2>
        <p>      <p>The American Cancer Society, founded in 1913 in New York City by 10 doctors and five laypeople, was originally called the American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC). At the time, cancer was a taboo subject, often hidden by both doctors and patients. The founders aimed to raise public awareness through articles, bulletins, and educational outreach.

            In 1928, the iconic Sword of Hope symbol was introduced, representing the crusade against cancer and the medical mission of the society. Over the years, the logo has evolved but continues to embody the organization's dedication to saving lives and improving the quality of life through its united network of workers, caregivers, and volunteers.</p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1913 as the American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC) in New York City, the American Cancer Society began with a mission to raise awareness about a disease that was shrouded in fear and denial. Its founders, including 10 doctors and five laypeople, worked tirelessly to educate the public through articles, bulletins, and nationwide campaigns. In 1928, the organization introduced its iconic Sword of Hope symbol, representing the crusading spirit of cancer control and the healing nature of its work. Over the past century, the logo has evolved but remains a powerful emblem of the Societyâ€™s mission to unite workers, caregivers, and volunteers in the fight to extend and enrich lives.</p>
